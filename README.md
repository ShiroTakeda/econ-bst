econ.bst
==============================

`econ.bst` is a BibTeX style file for economics. It provids the following
features:

* The author-year type citation (you need `natbib.sty` as well).
* Reference style used in economics papers (`econ.bst` is not a BibTeX style for a specific journal).
* Highly customizable.  You can easily customize reference style as you wish.
* You can use "certified random order" proposed by [Ray â“¡ Robson (2018), AER](http://dx.doi.org/10.1257/aer.20161492).
