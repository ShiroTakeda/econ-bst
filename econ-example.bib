                  pre-existing tax distortions in the labor market. Under
                  plausible parameters, this source of welfare loss can easily
                  be large enough to outweigh the entire partial equilibrium
                  welfare gain from the quota. Environmental taxes induce the
                  same interaction effect, however they also raise government
                  revenues. If the revenues are used to reduce distortionary
                  taxes, then most of this interaction effect can be
                  offset. Therefore, revenue-raising can be a necessary
                  condition for environmental policies to increase welfare.}

                  under complete information in rationalizable strategies. A
                  strict version of the monotonicity condition introduced by
                  Maskin is necessary under the solution concept of
                  rationalizability. Assuming the social choice function is
                  responsive, i.e. in distinct states it selects distinct
                  outcomes, we show that strict Maskin monotonicity is also
                  sufficient under a mild “no worst alternative” condition. In
                  particular, no economic condition is required. We discuss how
                  our results extend when the social choice function is not
                  responsive.}

                  formulation of international trade found in most computable
                  general equilibrium (CGE) models. International trade
                  structures consistent with the monopolistic competition models
                  suggested by Krugman (1980) and Melitz (2003) are presented in
                  a computational setting. The Melitz structure of heterogeneous
                  firms is particularly appealing given its consistency with
                  micro-level findings on firm sizes and export behavior. We
                  broaden the accessibility of these advanced trade theories for
                  CGE modelers, and strengthen the link between contemporary CGE
                  analysis and the broader trade community. Small-scale examples
                  of all three theories (Armington, Krugman and Melitz) are
                  introduced under a unified treatment. This is helpful in
                  translating the advanced theories into an environment that is
                  more familiar to CGE modelers. It is also helpful in showing
                  how the different approaches affect outcomes, in a relatively
                  transparent setting. Moving to an applied setting, we offer
                  our approach to calibration and computation of models that
                  include the Melitz heterogeneous firms structure. Our
                  applications include an analysis of economic integration and
                  subglobal climate policy in a model calibrated to the Global
                  Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) data. We do find that the
                  heterogeneous firms structure matters for conclusions drawn
                  from empirical CGE analysis. In our analysis of economic
                  integration we find endogenous entry leading to important
                  variety effects. We also find important productivity effects
                  related to the competitive selection of more productive
                  firms. In our examination of subglobal climate policy we see
                  substantial trade diversion in the Melitz structure. This
                  exacerbates the problem of carbon leakage and impacts the
                  emissions yields from carbon-based tariffs.}

  abstract     = {This paper develops a two-sector, two-country model, where
                  firms in a differentiated products sector choose between
                  exporting and multinational expansion as alternative modes of
                  foreign market penetration, based on a trade-off between
                  proximity and concentration advantages. The differentiated
                  sector is characterized by multi-stage production, with
                  increasing returns at the corporate level associated with some
                  activity such as R&D, scale economies at the plant level, and
                  a variable transport cost that rises with distance. A pure
                  multinational equilibrium, where two-way horizontal expansion
                  across borders completely supplants two-way trade in
                  differentiated products, is possible even in the absence of
                  factor proportion differences. It is more likely the greater
                  are transport costs relative to fixed plant costs, and the
                  greater are increasing returns at the corporate level relative
                  to the plant level. The model also establishes conditions for
                  a mixed equilibrium, in which national and multinational firms
                  coexist.},
